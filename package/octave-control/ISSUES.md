Need to run autoreconf and configure on the slicot libary in src/ to generate config.h - otherwise build errors.

Need to figure out to package all \*.m files and \*.oct files appropriately - similar to octave's *pgk build* command.

- Where does *PKG_ADD* come from?
- Where do the \*.oct files need to saved to?
